# hello-world!

I haven't coded a thing in pretty much 18 years and decided to try it out again, now when old age is crawling up on me ;)

At the moment im studying programming in C and i heard from friends that you just need to have a github account and learn the flow, if I  want to work as a developer in the future that is, so I decided to try this place out a bit.

Cheers!
